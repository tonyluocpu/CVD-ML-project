# CVD-ML-project
There are three master datasets:
    - single_merged+geo.csv is what we dealt with in grants writings.
    - three_data_merged+geo is what we will use from now on, but there is a claner version.
    - cvrm_mater transforms all number related features to [int, floats].

## CVRM codings
-   we should do all the codings in this folder. 

## functions_shortcut
-   some functions we could just store here if we anticipate to use them in the future. 

## grants_datasets
-   all the old scripts and datasets. 

## cvrm_master
    - the cleaner version. Delete columns missing >= 95%, covert all kinds of invalid inputs to NAs...
    - For different analysis this dataset should be cleaned further.
